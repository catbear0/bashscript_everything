# bs_vrth
Usage: 

 helloworld is a very simple playbook example. It can be used to deploy web-server stack (nginx, mysql, php-fpm) on a remote server. As this is just example set, it's index page says 'Hello, world!" It gives back 444 error code instead of standard error codes and this is the only interesting feature. Yet it's ready to use and you can build a test site or personal homepage in minutes.
