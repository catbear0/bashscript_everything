Usage: if you ever run into FreeBSD release like 8.* which EOL has come already, and OS has neither <em>ports</em> subsystem nor <em>package</em> working, you'll need this. Tar wasn't working as well, so I had to tranfer files with rsync and compress them remotely. <em>getfacl</em> command had to be used cause rsync version was old as mammoth and -p flag didn't help.
